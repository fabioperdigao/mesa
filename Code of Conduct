Making Ecology Simple and Accessible Code of conduct

Here, in the MSOA, we hope to create a friendly and encouraging environment, always helping each other when we can and being respectful with our community in the same way. To make this possible, we need some rules, that are listed below:

1.	Be supportive, respectful and empathic with the others members of our community.
2.	Give feedback to other people's work, without being rude, our counstraining, and transmitting your message through a friendly way. In the other hand, accept constructive feedbacks in the same way.
3.	Keep in mind that we all are interested in one goal, so focus on what is best for the community instead of what is best for the individual

We do not tolerate any forms of:
1.	Racism, sexism, intolerance and other forms of discriminatory.
2.	Public or private harassment
3.	The use of sexualized language, images or any other form of communication
4.	Posting sexual or violent material
5.	Being violent 
6.	Private information like emails, messages sent privately, numbers, address etc. 
7.	Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
8.	Personal insults
9.	Repetitive behaviors that bother any other member. When someone ask to stop something that is bothering him, we must stop.
